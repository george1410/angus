                    <p class="body-text">Raid Of Heroes is a (very) small game that I have created. It is a tile-based adventure game that is written primarily in JavaScript. The project began as part of my college coursework, where I was tasked with creating an event-driven application. I decided to attempt JavaScript game development, and for a first attempt I believe it went rather well. The entire game is written in JavaScript, with a couple of bits of the JQuery library dropped in here and there. I gained a lot of knowledge and inspiration from countless hours of youtube videos, and they all lead me to create what I am now calling Raid Of Heroes.</p>

                    <p>This page on my website is going to be used to host information about Raid Of Heroes, and it will also be the first place that I will announce changes to the game. All of the code will be made available on github as I continue to develop the game. </p>
